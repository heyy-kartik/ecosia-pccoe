## 11. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 11.1 Technical Risks

**Risk:** AI API costs exceed budget
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching, rate limiting, and cost monitoring; use fallback simpler algorithms for non-critical features

**Risk:** Performance degradation at scale
- **Mitigation:** Load testing before launch; auto-scaling infrastructure; performance monitoring and optimization

**Risk:** Data privacy compliance violations
- **Mitigation:** Legal review of data practices; GDPR/COPPA compliance audit; minimal data collection; clear privacy policy

### 11.2 Product Risks

**Risk:** Low user engagement post-launch
- **Mitigation:** Beta testing with target users; engaging onboarding experience; regular content updates; community building

**Risk:** Content accuracy concerns
- **Mitigation:** Partner with climate science experts; peer review process; cite authoritative sources; update based on latest research

**Risk:** Competition from established platforms
- **Mitigation:** Focus on AI personalization differentiator; superior UX; community engagement; continuous innovation

### 11.3 Operational Risks

**Risk:** Timeline delays affecting launch
- **Mitigation:** Build buffer into timeline; prioritize ruthlessly for MVP; daily standups; early identification of blockers

**Risk:** Team resource constraints
- **Mitigation:** Hire key roles early; cross-training team members; use contractors for specialized tasks; clear role definitions
